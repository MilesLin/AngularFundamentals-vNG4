# AngularFundamentals

The Project is Angular 4 version, it was updated from [Angular Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-fundamentals/table-of-contents). And I also integrate with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), so that it will send real http request.

## Prerequisites

You have to install [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)  before running it.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install -g json-server
```

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MilesLin/AngularFundamentals-vNG4.git
npm install
npm start
```
